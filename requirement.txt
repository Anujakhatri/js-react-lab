🗂️ How npm fits into your React project

try {
  // fetch + parse only
} catch (err) {
  // API error
}

try {
  // analytics / logging / appwrite
} catch (err) {
  console.warn('Non-critical error', err);
}

TMDB VS Appwrite

    User search → TMDB
                ↓
            Appwrite (store)
                ↓
        App trending section

Think of Appwrite as three things:

    A database
    An SDK (JavaScript library)
    A URL your app talks to

Your React app:

    does NOT run Appwrite
    does NOT host Appwrite
    only calls it

Appwrite is used for things like:

    saving data (database)
    tracking searches
    user authentication
    analytics (e.g., “most searched movies”)
    server-side logic (functions)
